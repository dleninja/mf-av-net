AVNet in Python using Keras
===============================================================

Overview
------------
Retinal diseases effect Arteries and Veins separately. Current methods for artery-vein (AV) pixel-wise classification or 
segmentation requires manual effort from trained clinicians, therefore is a burden in a clinical setting.  In this project we present
a deep learning approach for dispersion compensation using a fully convolutional network (FCN)
named Artery-vein classification network (AVNet) for optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCTA).
